## 💡 Key Takeaways & Notes
* **Generics & Type Safety:** Mastered using Generics (`<T>`) to write flexible, reusable code while maintaining type safety and performance (avoiding expensive boxing/unboxing operations).
* **Strategic Collection Use:** Refined the ability to select the perfect data structure—using `HashSet` for unique constraints (AddressBook), `Dictionary` for O(1) lookups (SmartCheckout), and `PriorityQueue` for triage systems.
* **Algorithmic Nuance:** Moved beyond standard sorting to implement **Radix Sort** (non-comparison based) for large integer datasets and **Backtracking** for solving complex constraint satisfaction problems.
* **Stream Processing:** Gained insight into I/O Streams for handling file data efficiently, understanding the difference between buffered processing and loading entire datasets into memory.
* **Iterative System Design:** The **Address Book (11 Versions)** project highlighted the importance of modular architecture and iterative development—starting small and scaling features without breaking existing logic.
