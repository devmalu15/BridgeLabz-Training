## 💡 Key Takeaways & Notes
* **Compiler:** Unlike Java's `javac`, modern .NET relies heavily on the `dotnet` CLI toolchain rather than raw `csc` commands.
* **Execution:** `dotnet run` builds and executes in one step. `dotnet script` is great for Python-like testing.
* **Git:** Always use a `.gitignore` to keep `bin/` and `obj/` folders out of the repo.
