## 💡 Key Takeaways & Notes
* **OOP & Modeling:** Moving beyond syntax to "Scenario Based" problems highlighted the importance of modeling real-world entities using **Encapsulation** (protecting data) and **Inheritance** (code reuse).
* **Data Structures Matter:** Choosing the right collection is critical for performance—e.g., using `Dictionary` for O(1) lookups in the *Smart Home Automation* project versus iterating through a `List`.
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Understanding **Big O Notation** is vital. Implementing Binary Search requires data to be sorted first, making it faster than Linear Search for large datasets.
* **C# Keywords:** Learned that `static` members belong to the type itself (shared across instances), while `sealed` is essential for preventing unauthorized inheritance in security-critical classes.
* **Dev Tools:** Modern .NET relies on the `dotnet` CLI. `dotnet run` handles build+execute, while `.gitignore` is mandatory to keep `bin/` and `obj/` clutter out of the repo.
